# Text Classification through a LSTM-based model

The aim of this repository is to show a baseline model for text classification by implementing a LSTM-based model coded in PyTorch. In order to provide a better understanding of the model, it will be used a dataset of Tweets provided by Kaggle. 

## 1. Data
As it is mentioned above, the dataset we are woking with is about Tweets regarding fake news. The first rows of the dataset looks like this:

|id| text | target |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Contenido de la celda  | Contenido de la celda  |Contenido de la celda  |
| Contenido de la celda  | Contenido de la celda  |Contenido de la celda  |
